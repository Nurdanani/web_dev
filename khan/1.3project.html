        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For the dough, dissolve a little sugar in warm milk, literally 1 teaspoon, add yeast. I use pressed yeast, my baking always works with it) Carefully crack the mass with a whisk so that the yeast completely dissolves, and leave everything for 10 minutes. During this time, a fluffy foam will appear on the surface, which means that the yeast has begun to act.
</p>

 
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the egg to the bowl (I beat it lightly with a fork beforehand), a little salt, the rest of the sugar (intended for the dough) and vanilla sugar. Also add the melted butter (you can melt it over low heat, in a water bath or in the microwave, as I did). Mix the resulting mass well.
</p>

 <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin to introduce the sifted flour. Stir first with a whisk or spoon, and then put the dough on the work surface and knead with your hands. Knead for about 10 minutes, during which time the dough will become homogeneous and smooth. Please note: you may need a little more or less flour than indicated in the recipe, there's nothing wrong with that.
</p>


 <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Transfer the dough to a deep bowl, cover with a towel and leave in a warm place. I usually use a slow cooker, set the "Multi-cooker" mode, set the temperature to 35 degrees and the time to 1 hour. I put the plate with the dough directly into the slow cooker and close the lid. The dough rises just fine! After an hour, the dough should be kneaded, put in a plate and left again, but for 30-40 minutes, so that it fits.
</p>


 <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> the dough turned out to be just perfect: smooth and fluffy! Roll it out into a large layer about 6-7 mm thick. Brush with a thin layer of softened butter. Mix the sugar and cinnamon (it's better to use cane brown sugar, but I didn't have any, so I took regular white sugar). Sprinkle the resulting mixture over the entire dough layer.
</p>


 <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> wrap the dough in the roll as tightly as possible. Now you need to cut this large roll into small pieces, about 4-5 cm wide. It is not very convenient to cut with a knife, so I advise you to use a regular thread. Take a small piece of thread. Run it under the roll, lift the edges and cross them, stretch. This way you will get a smooth and beautiful cut. So cut the whole roll.
